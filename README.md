# practice_problems
Typical practice problems appear in interviews

## List of problems
1. Find the most frequent integer in an array

2. Find pairs in an integer array whose sum is equal to 10 (bonus: do it in linear time)

3. Given 2 integer arrays, determine if the 2nd array is a rotated version of the 1st array

4. Ex. Original Array A={1,2,3,5,6,7,8} Rotated Array B={5,6,7,8,1,2,3}

5. Write fibonacci iteratively and recursively (bonus: use dynamic programming)

6. Find the only element in an array that only occurs once

7. Find the common elements of 2 int arrays

8. Implement binary search of a sorted array of integers

9. Implement binary search in a rotated array (ex. {5,6,7,8,1,2,3})

10. Use dynamic programming to find the first X prime numbers

11. Write a function that prints out the binary form of an int

12. Implement parseInt

13. Implement squareroot function

14. Implement an exponent function (bonus: now try in log(n) time)

15. Write a multiply function that multiples 2 integers without using *

16. Given n points, return the top k points that are closest to the origin
